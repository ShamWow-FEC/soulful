## Instructions for how to deploy the webpage:

Fork this repo into your local machine and do the following.
  
Generate your own github api key with these settings:  
- read:org  
- user  
- read:user  
- user:email  
- user:follow  

Create a .env file and add the following keys and values. Your .env file should end up looking something like this:  
  
PORT="3000"  
GITKEY="GITHUB_API_KEY_HERE"  

-<b>NOTE don’t include the apostrophes</b>

After finishing your .env file and saving it, you can now ```npm install``` in the root directory.

Once that finishes you can run ```npm run server-dev``` which should start up the server and also webpack.   
  
Navigate in your browser to localhost:(PORT_THAT_YOU_CHOSE_HERE) and you should see the webpage!
